## üìù **REFLECTION QUESTIONS**

After each challenge set, ask yourself:

- **What pattern did I just explore?**
- **Where else in the app does this pattern appear?**
- **How would I explain this to someone else?**
- **What would break if I removed this piece?**
- **How does this help in an exam scenario?**

**Remember**: Understanding WHY something works is more valuable than memorizing HOW it works! üß†
