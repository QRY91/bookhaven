## 🎯 **Key Pattern Recognition**

### **When you see these exam requirements, think BookHaven:**

**"Multi-project solution with shared models"**
→ BookHaven architecture pattern

**"Entity relationships with navigation properties"**
→ Book-Author-Category relationship pattern

**"Advanced search and filtering"**
→ BooksController Index pattern

**"Role-based authorization"**
→ Admin/Client pattern with [Authorize] attributes

**"CRUD operations with forms"**
→ Standard controller + view patterns

**"Seed data with admin user"**
→ SeedData.Initialize pattern

## 📝 **Quick Reference Checklists**

### **✅ Models Checklist**

- [ ] Navigation properties marked `virtual`
- [ ] Foreign key properties (AuthorId, CategoryId)
- [ ] Validation attributes ([Required], [Range], etc.)
- [ ] Nullable reference types where appropriate

### **✅ DbContext Checklist**

- [ ] Inherits from IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>
- [ ] DbSet properties for each entity
- [ ] base.OnModelCreating() called first
- [ ] Registered in Program.cs with connection string

### **✅ Controllers Checklist**

- [ ] Constructor injection of DbContext
- [ ] Include() statements for related data
- [ ] ViewBag/ViewData for dropdowns
- [ ] Async/await patterns
- [ ] Authorization attributes

### **✅ Views Checklist**

- [ ] @model directive at top
- [ ] asp-for attributes for form controls
- [ ] asp-validation-for for error display
- [ ] @section Scripts for validation
- [ ] Null-safe navigation (@item.Author?.FullName)

### **✅ Authentication Checklist**

- [ ] AddIdentity() in Program.cs
- [ ] UseAuthentication() before UseAuthorization()
- [ ] AddRazorPages() and MapRazorPages()
- [ ] Admin user in seed data
- [ ] [Authorize] attributes on controllers

## 🎓 **Study Tips for Exam Success**

### **1. Practice the Full Stack** (Don't skip layers)

- Models → DbContext → Controllers → Views → Auth
- Each layer depends on the previous ones
- **Build muscle memory** for the complete flow

### **2. Master the Relationships**

- One-to-Many (Author → Books, Category → Books)
- Many-to-Many via junction (Order → OrderItem → Book)
- **Navigation properties** are exam favorites

### **3. Know Your Patterns**

- **Include()** for loading related data
- **SelectList** for dropdown populations
- **PRG pattern** (Post-Redirect-Get)
- **ViewBag** for preserving filter state

### **4. Speed Tricks**

- **Scaffold controllers** to get basic CRUD fast
- **Copy-paste and modify** similar patterns
- **Use snippets** for common code blocks
- **Focus on working code** over perfection

### **5. Common Transformations**

- **BookHaven → Restaurant**: Book→MenuItem, Author→Restaurant, Category→FoodType
- **BookHaven → Movie**: Book→Movie, Author→Director, Category→Genre
- **Same patterns, different names!**
