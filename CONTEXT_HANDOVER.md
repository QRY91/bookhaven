# BookHaven MultiProject Example - Context Handover

## Current State

- **Authentication:** ASP.NET Core Identity is set up with ApplicationUser and ApplicationDbContext.
- **DbContext:** ApplicationDbContext now contains DbSet properties for Authors, Books, and Categories.
- **Controllers:** All controllers use ApplicationDbContext for data access.
- **Migrations:** Old migrations referencing BookHavenDbContext have been deleted. New migrations should be created for ApplicationDbContext.
- **Seed Data:** SeedData.cs seeds roles (Admin, Client) and an admin user (admin@bookhaven.com / Admin123!).
- **Identity UI:** Default Identity UI is available for login, registration, and user management.
- **Google Auth:** Placeholder for Google authentication is present (requires ClientId/Secret in appsettings.json).

## Key Changes Made

- Removed all references to BookHavenDbContext and replaced with ApplicationDbContext.
- Added missing DbSet properties to ApplicationDbContext.
- Cleaned up old migrations and migration snapshots.
- Ensured all controllers and services use the new context.
- Updated project files to include all necessary Identity and EF Core packages.

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild the solution** to ensure all errors are resolved.
2. **Add a new migration and update the database:**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
3. **Configure Google authentication** in `appsettings.json` if needed.
4. **Test the application:**
   - Login as admin (admin@bookhaven.com / Admin123!)
   - Register new users
   - Test CRUD for Books, Authors, Categories
5. **(Optional) Add more seed data** for demo purposes.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing tables, ensure you have run the migrations.
- If you see errors about missing packages, run `dotnet restore`.
- If you see errors about missing context properties, ensure ApplicationDbContext has all required DbSet properties.
